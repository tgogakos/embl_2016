-ROC curves
-Aseq - Mihaela Zavolan 
-extract residuals from PCA analysis to plot barplots and 
detect correlations for tRNA enzyme screen and C3PO data
and gain insights into functional aspects or GO groups
-pairwise covariance correlation and magnitude
-use of scRNAseq as tool to identiy which cell type/class 
is mostly affected by a regulator. tease out specificity effects
-eQTLs
-manhattan plots
-tSNE 
-diffusion maps
-look up circadian/ceel cycle expression of TSN (Felix Naef papers)
-nagative binomial correlation analysis to identify genes left and right of 
a branch point/cluster (Satija talk)
